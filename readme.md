This is the auto-generated files from WP-CLI when building the sample tests (`wp scaffold`).

**Usage & Installation**

1. Download and save the files into your plugin folder or clone the repo into your plugin folder (`git clone https://github.com/DigitalLeap/wp-plugin-tests.git your-plugin-folder`).
2. Edit `tests/bootstrap.php` and replace `your-plugin-file` with the slug of your plugin.
3. To run the tests locally, you'll need [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit#installation) installed. Alternatively, it includes a .travis.yml to have the tests automatically run on Travis - simply connect your repo on Github to Travis CI.
4. Run phpunit within your plugin directory (if you're using Vagrant, remember to ssh into your box). If you're using Travis, simply push into your Github repo.
